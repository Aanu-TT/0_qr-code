### What I learned

Building this QR code, consolidated all i had learnt for over a month. I didn't think my learning was going anywhere, alas! This exercise showed me, I was actually learning. All I needed was application.

I understood the font-family import of new fonts better and finally got to use flex box!


### Continued development

I still require a lot of practice in code writing. I feel, the code could be neater. Suggestions and constructive criticism are much welcome.


### Useful resources

Google is a coder's best friend. I'm eager to see how much knowledge I'll draw from googling

## Acknowledgments

I'm proud to say I did this myself, I'm sure there'll be areas to correct, here and there. But as my first project, I'm satisfied.

Frontend Mentor for creating this wonderful learning aid.
